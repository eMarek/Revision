Revision
========

Realtime collaboration tool. Right now is still in alpha version.

### How is applied
You can calculate changes between two text. Very similar to `google-diff-match-patch`, just a little bit faster. You must read entire  instructions. We have sweet candies.

### How to install
```
npm install -g revision
```
Do not forget `-g` command, otherwise it will not work.  
Of course you will need node.js and a fluffy unicorn.

### How to use it
To calculate changes enter original text as first argument and changed text as second argument when calling `revision` from you terminal.
```
revision "Despicable Me" "Despicable Minions"
```
You will get JSON with changes based on original text.
```
[ { a: '-', s: 'e', l: 1, p: 13, f: 13, t: 13 },
  { a: '+', s: 'inions', l: 6, p: 14, f: 13, t: 18 } ]
```
If you do not understand what does this mean, is because it is intended to be so. Take a coffee break and you will figure it out.

### How to proceed
All this above is just a little piece of entire module. Yeah I am still developing it. But you can test it. Running `revision` module gets you fully operational webserver. Put this two lines in `/index.js` file.

```js
// index.js
var app = require("revision");
app.run();
```
Start it with node like this `node index.js` and then open you browser on `http://127.0.0.1:8888/`. Voil√†!  
You should get `404 Not Found` error and this is so freaking awsome, isn't it?!

### Serving static files

Our module can serve static files in `/public` folder with correct MIME type. Anything in this folder is immediately available in your browser. By default is loaded `/public/index.html` file. Create it and you will get rid of 404.

### Getting data over API

There is a simple API which could:
* gather request payload
* response with send function

All handlers must be located in `/api` folder and have quite a classic structure. Look at this simple `/api/villain.js` handler.

```js
// api/villain.js

"use strict";

var api = {};

/* api/gru.json
-------------------------------------------------- */
api["gru.json"] = function(req, rsp, data) {

    var stole = req.payload.stole;
    var minions;

    if (stole == "Statue of Liberty") {
        minions = "Cheering!";
    } else if (stole == "Eiffel Tower") {
        minions = "Cheer stop?";
    } else {
        minions = "Don't give a single duck."
    }

    rsp.send({
        "say": "yay",
        "minions": minions
    });
};

module.exports = api;
```

Don't worry. I will explain you. It serves `http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/gru.json` requests. It expects  `stole` request payload. Depending on this variable are `minions` declared. At the end `send` function responds with an obvious JSON.

### What about config

You can use it of course. It is easy peasy to use it. Make a `/config.js` file with following structure.

```js
// config.js

"use strict";

module.exports = function(appRun) {

    var data = {};

    // example
    data["minionColors"] = ["yellow", "purple"];

    // salt and key
    data["salt"] = "DO NOT USE THIS SALT IN PRODUCTION";
    data["key"] = "EITHER THIS KEY";

    appRun(data);
};
```

You are probably asking yourself why is `config` usefull. We will show you. Anything you will add to the `data` object will be available in all your API handlers. For example above, we could use `data.minionColors` in our `gru.json` API. As you can see, any date you would like to be available in every API, you should put it in `config` file. It is very handy for database connections.

### What about controller

Controller is used for very similar matter as config file, passing `data` to API handlers. But it has one significant difference. It is executed for every request and not just once as config. From that perspective is suitable for user authentication. It has following structure.

```js
// controller.js

"use strict";

module.exports = function(req, rsp, data, handler) {

    // do i have session
    if (!req.headers.hasOwnProperty("session")) {
        rsp.send({
            "say": "out",
            "msg": "Login required."
        });
        return;
    }

    handler(req, rsp, data);
};
```

### What is next

Take a look in the example folder and give us some feedback. Right now we are working on operational transformation which will be build and will be totaly crazy. Soon.
